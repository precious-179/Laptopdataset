#  Laptop Dataset Analysis
This project explores a comprehensive dataset of laptops to uncover insights about pricing, specifications, and brand trends. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical summaries to better understand the laptop market.
##  Dataset Overview
The dataset contains **11,768 entries** with the following features:
- `Brand`
- `Processor`
- `RAM (GB)`
- `Storage`
- `GPU`	
- `Screen Size (inch)`
- `Resolution`
- `Battery Life (hours)`
- `Weight (kg)`
- `Operating System`
- `Price ($)`
## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Key Analyses

- **Top 5 Most Common Brands**: Apple, HP, MSI, Microsoft, Dell
- **Average Price by Brand**: Apple leads with the highest average price
- **Processor vs Price**: Intel i9 and AMD Ryzen 9 command premium pricing
- **Operating System Distribution**: Windows, FreeDOS, Linux, macOS
- **Resolution Impact**: Higher resolutions correlate with higher prices
- **RAM vs Price**: More RAM generally means higher cost
- **Battery Life Trends**: Average battery life is ~8 hours
- **Screen Size vs Battery Life**: Slight variations across sizes
- **Weight Distribution**: Ranges from 1.2kg to 3.5kg
- **GPU Influence**: Discrete GPUs like RTX 3060 and RX 6800 increase price
- **Storage Type Impact**: SSDs are more expensive than HDDs
- **Total Sales Value**: $25,696,270.68
